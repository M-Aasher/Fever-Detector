# Fever-Detector

A simple C program that checks if a user has a fever based on their body temperature. It demonstrates the use of conditional (if–else) statements for basic decision-making.

## Purpose

To practice conditional logic using the if–else structure by comparing user input to a fixed threshold (99°F).

## Logic

• Input the temperature from the user.
• Compare it with 99°F.
• If temperature > 99 → Display “You have fever”.
• Else → Display “You don’t have fever”.

## Example Input/Output

Enter your temperature: 102                                                        
You have fever                                                                                  

Enter your temperature: 97                                                                 
You dont have fever
